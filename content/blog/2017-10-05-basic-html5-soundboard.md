I made a [thing](/projects/soundboard/). It has other people’s giant images and audio that I haven’t bothered resizing or compressing so it can take maybe 20 seconds to load as you click through the sounds. I made it as something my kids can play with on a tablet and because I’ve always thought it would be a great use for the new audio APIs in HTML5. The source code is [here](https://github.com/pilkch/soundboard). Enjoy.
