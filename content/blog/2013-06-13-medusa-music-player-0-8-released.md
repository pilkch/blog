---

I've release a new version of Medusa music player with these features:
- Simple interface
- Last.fm support
- Date added and a full file path column
- Drag and drop from the file manager
- Moving files to the trash folder
- Move files to a particular folder and remember the last 5 folders
- Extra columns
- Show the background thread progress on the statusbar
- Import playlist from Rhythmbox and Banshee
- Autoplay at last track at startup

New:
- Web server for controlling playback, volume and deleting tracks remotely
- Check for updates via version.xml
- Popup notifications when a new track is played

Still to come:
- Easy tag editing for multiple files at once
