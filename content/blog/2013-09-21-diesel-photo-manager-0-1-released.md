title: Diesel Photo Manager 0.1 Released
---

I couldn't find a photo browser for Linux that also imported my photos in the folder format I wanted so I created my own.

This is the first release and it has these features:

- Simple interface
- Thumbnail grid mode
- Single photo mode
- Import and sort photos into folders based on the date
- Convert files to dng
- Show the background thread progress on the statusbar
- Check for updates via version.xml
- Default to dark theme (Can be overridden with the â€“light command line parameter)

Still to come:

- Fixes to the single photo viewing mode
- Popup notifications when a new track is played
- Work out what I want to do with the photo browser
