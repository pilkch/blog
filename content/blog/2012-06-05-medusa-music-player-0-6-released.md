title: Medusa Music Player 0.6 Released
---

I've release a new version of Medusa music player with these features:
- Simple interface
- Last.fm support
- Date added and a full file path column

New:
- Drag and drop from the file manager
- Auto play last track at startup
- Moving files to the trash folder
- Move files to a particular folder and remember the last 5 folders

Still to come:
- Easy tag editing for multiple files at once
