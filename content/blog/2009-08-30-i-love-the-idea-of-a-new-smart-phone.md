title: I Love the Idea of a New Smart Phone
---

The list of awesome phones:  
[HTC Phones](http://www.htc.com/)  
[OpenMoko](http://www.openmoko.com/)  
[Palm Pre](http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/)

However, a new hotness has just been born.

The [Nokia n900](http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/).

- 800 × 480 resolution video recording

The important part:  
Development in [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) and [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) are supported, using [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/).  
Unfortunately it looks like [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) is not supported so anyone wanting to do any [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) will have to do it in Python.  
That is great that Nokia are supporting open standards, releasing a mobile phone running [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). It would be nice if they supported C++ too, but that is just my personal preference, and it may come in the future, I know all the C++ jazz is quite complex and definitely non-trivial.

I’d still rather use Python than C. I certainly hope that Windows Mobile dies and the highly overrated iPhone becomes less popular, not completely die, just put in its place. I would love to see the world embrace [open standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard), [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and a rise in [<acronym title="Digital Restrictions Management">DRM free</acronym>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_restrictions_management#.22DRM-Free.22), happy, feel good devices, gain popularity and eventually dominate the market and warm people’s hearts.
