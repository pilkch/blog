Last night we went to [The Pheonix](http://the-riotact.com/?p=9752) (Where I met Christina almost 3 years ago!) and they had [The Ellis Collective](http://www.theelliscollective.com/) playing with two other bands. The girl on the violin was the highlight, reminding [Sam](http://www.rephrase.net/) and I of [Fourplay](http://www.fourplayjazz.com/). It would have been good if there were more violin solos, also the songs on their site just don’t do the violin justice.  
I heart [covers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version). No wait, I heart covers more than everyone in the world put together. YouTube is awesome for finding covers, it can be quite patchy, but basically everyone votes down the worst ones so you only view the gold.

[Johnny](http://www.youtube.com/user/johnnyonline) from Australia.  
[Kina Grannis](http://www.youtube.com/user/kinagrannis)

[Johnny sings Exit Music (from a Film) by Radiohead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMZVVwHS4rI) (And he does drums as well, awesome (Well not at the same time, but still awesome)).  
[Kina sings 1234 by Fiest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wQabvrA2XI)  
[Johnny sings Waltz #2 by Elliot Smith](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvEmnfUX3NE)  
[Kina sings New Soul by Yael Naïm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzoQtq0MLeg)  
[Johnny sings Mad World by Gary Jules ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ54eZlGx4s)  
[Johnny sings Karma Police by Radiohead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szB74WuelHI)

[Kina sings Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTuVnX1ZGPA)  
[Johnny sings Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTuVnX1ZGPA)  
No one is as awesome as Hallelujah [Jesus himself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AratTMGrHaQ) though.

I also heart mashups.  
[Jack Conte](http://www.youtube.com/user/jackcontemusic) specialises in both covering and mashing up songs, some of them are downloadable [at](http://www.myspace.com/jackconte).  
[Jack Conte – Radiohead/Chopin mashup/cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X-PRpqj7N4)  
[Jack Conte – Gorillaz – Feel Good Inc. cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA-kf_4D2Ro&feature=related) watch this if only for the ending hilarious.  
[Jack Conte – Aphex Twin/Bright Eyes mashup/cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW0ulJ5QCcw&feature=related)

This wouldn’t be a blog entry by Chris if it didn’t include:  
[Johnny sings \*cough\* Britney \*cough\*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l05Qi-ZjeRQ)  
[Yael Naïm New Soul and Toxic](</files/Yael Naim.zip>)
