title: Medusa Music Player 0.7 Released
---

I've release a new version of Medusa music player with these features:
- Simple interface
- Last.fm support
- Date added and a full file path column
- Drag and drop from the file manager
- Auto play last track at startup
- Moving files to the trash folder
- Move files to a particular folder and remember the last 5 folders

New:
- Extra columns
- Show the background thread progress on the statusbar
- Import playlist from Rhythmbox and Banshee
- Add autoplay at last track at startup

Still to come:
- Easy tag editing for multiple files at once
