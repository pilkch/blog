[![Colour Picker in action](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colourpicker.png)](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colourpicker.png)

I created a colour picker in JavaScript, then I created 3 variations that simulate the [common colour blindnesses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness). They are all linked so that when you select a colour in one it picks the "same" colour in the others. I mainly just created it out of interest. I realise there are similar colour blind simulator tools, but I hadn't seen any that used linked colour pickers like this.

I donâ€™t normally use JavaScript, but I had fun doing this. The syntax is easy to read and relatively sane. The rapid development is great and the HTML5 features such as canvas are easy to use and quite powerful.
